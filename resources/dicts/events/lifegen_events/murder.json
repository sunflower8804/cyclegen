One afternoon, finally fed up with the kit's constant questions about one of v_c's stories, you slip out of the nursery. v_c is resting in the dappled shade, clearly tired from the heat. Your claws curl into the sandy earth as an idea begins to form. A little later, you approach v_c, a bit of moss dripping with water, and a little something extra, gingerly held in your teeth. Finding the snake's venom was tricky, but the sound of v_c's strangled gasps makes it worth the effort."

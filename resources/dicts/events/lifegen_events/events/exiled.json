        "Life outside of the borders of your home is harder than you imagined. You miss the company of others within the camp, the comradery of your Clanmates.",
        "Prey is harder to come by out here. You take the time to sneak into c_nClan territory as carefully as you can, but get caught by r_w and chased away again.",
        "You meet a loner as you wander around. They seem wary of you however, and soon moves on.",
        "You meet a small group of rogues you know have been causing problems for your former Clan. With a bit of well-timed mischief, you manage to chase them off without a hitch.",
        "One day you notice a pup wandering just outside of the territory looking lost. Oh - that's r_k. You don't know how {PRONOUN/r_k/subject} go there but you watch over them until a patrol of frantic warriors comes to collect them.",
        "While lingering on the border you notice r_a alone. You also notice a rogue stalking closer. You yowl a warning, and r_a puffs up in shock before turning tail and racing back the way {PRONOUN/r_a/subject} came.",
        "You notice a flourishing patch of herbs. c_nClan would find this useful... You end up deciding to leave some on a path you know r_m takes daily.",
        "A group of rogues approach you to learn more about c_nClan. You sense they're up to no good. You share a bit of information anyways, and wish them luck with whatever they're planning.",
        "You watch the daily life of your former Clan with growing resentment...",
        "You catch a lantern mouse right before it crosses the border.",
        "A noodlefly escapes from r_w - and right into your awaiting paws. You sneer your gratitude as r_w hisses and spits in fury.",
        "You spot a patrol meandering along the border chatting idly.",

        "Some rogues are causing trouble for c_nClan. Without hesitation you chase them off. c_nClan is yours to mess with - not theirs.",
        "r_w is stalking a squidcada. You take a second before deciding to have some fun. You yowl to scare both r_w and the bird. It takes off in a burst of panic, and your former Clanmate spits at you.",
        "While sneaking around on c_nClan territory, you notice a patch of herbs flourishing. Just for the sake of it you trample part of the plant before leaving. r_m will be spitting mad later!",
        "When you meet a passing loner, they strike up conversation. You hold nothing back about your past in c_nClan, however, and the loner is quick to make an excuse to leave.",
        "You meet with a rogue you know is pleasant to work with. With your information, they are able to put together some plans to make c_nClan regret exiling you.",
        "Exile is anything but boring. You can always bother your former Clanmates - or accomplish your dreams of exploring freely.",
        "You mark your scent on the c_nClan borders. You're still here. They'd do well to remember that."

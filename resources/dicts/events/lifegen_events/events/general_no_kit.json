        "r_q is looking worn out. You offer to watch the pups for a bit so {PRONOUN/r_q/subject} can take a rest. r_q is thrilled and accepts. When {PRONOUN/r_q/subject} {VERB/r_q/come/comes} back later the pups are napping and r_q looks much better.",
        "You help out with a few den repairs this cycle. The camp looks much better in the end, and should be good for another cycle.",
        "It's a dreary day today. r_w1 and r_w2 just came back from patrol and are sheltered beside you. The three of you share tongues for a bit, grooming out damp fur.",
        "Lightning is striking in the sky. You watch it with r_d, r_w1, r_w2, and r_m.",

        "You're out with r_a and r_w today. You're not on patrol, really, all of you just wanted to stretch your legs.",
        "A Clan meeting has your attention. Danger in the territory means every slugcat should be on high alert this cycle.",
        "Scavengers on the territory have the Clan nervous. You reassure r_q and r_e that they won't find the camp.",
        "r_k is causing trouble - and you're the first one on the scene. With a fond sigh you herd {PRONOUN/r_k/object} back to the nursery.",
        "The Clan is having a lazy sunhigh. You end up chatting with r_w1, r_w2, and r_m about nothing in particular.",

        "r_w is talking about a pet {PRONOUN/r_w/subject} met on patrol. You recall that pet as well. Small world!",
        "You're helping r_m since {PRONOUN/r_m/subject} needed extra paws. {PRONOUN/r_m/subject/CAP}{VERB/r_m/'re/'s} grateful to you for the assistance, and it turns out to be a great opportunity to connect with {PRONOUN/r_m/object} more.",
        "It's time to clean out your nest! Fresh moss is great, but you will miss the bits of fluff and feathers. r_q seems to notice your unhappiness and offers some of {PRONOUN/r_q/poss} supply for you!",
        "r_d notices you're a little down. {PRONOUN/r_d/subject/CAP} {VERB/r_d/spend/spends} quite a bit of time talking through some things with you. By the end, a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.",
        "r_m notices you looking tired. You reassure {PRONOUN/r_m/object} that you're fine but relent when {PRONOUN/r_m/subject} {VERB/r_m/give/gives} you some herbs to help you sleep.",

        "A stroll today has let you discover a hidden gem of an area on the territory. Maybe you can use this as a nice hideaway on occasion!",
        "Some time today was well spent lost in your own thoughts. Reflection is always a useful tool.",
        "What you think of r_w has become relevant today within the Clan. Why is every slugcat so nosy?",
        "After noticing you being quiet today, r_d comes over to check in with you. A pleasant conversation boosts your mood.",
        "r_a seems to be having a very hard time lately. You extend some kindness to {PRONOUN/r_a/object}, and {PRONOUN/r_a/subject}{VERB/r_a/'re/'s} soon bouncing back thanks to you.",
        "You stop to take in the moment. What a moon it's been. What a time to be you!",
        "Did you just see something out the corner of your eyes? Or have you just spooked yourself for no good reason?",
        "You trip on your way to the fresh-kill pile. Half the Clan saw it, but r_w is nice enough to help you play it off. Whew!",
        "There's fun to be had this cycle! l_n had suggested playing some games as a Clan. Your team won!",

        "A buzzing fly is being annoying. It ends up being caught in your keen paws for it's crime of being bothersome.",
        "What an unusual gold butterfly! Strange... Maybe it's a sign? You ponder it for a bit.",
        "r_w is going on and on and on about a really cool cloud. You're caught yawning at the tale, and r_w is cross for a few days. Oops?",
        "You look to the stars one evening and ponder. Are The Ascended really watching?",
        "You look to the night sky one evening and wonder if the darkness is the Rot Wound's influence.",

        "r_k is admiring you it seems! It's probably because of your boldness. Or maybe that you're confident? You're also pretty fierce and...",

        "Bragging is unbecoming, r_w says. You turn your nose at {PRONOUN/r_w/object}. It's not bragging if it's true! It's sharing your accomplishments!",

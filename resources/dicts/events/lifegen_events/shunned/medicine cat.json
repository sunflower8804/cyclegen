        "The herbs you used to find solace in seem tainted now. Every leaf you touch reminds you of your act.",
        "Slugcats flinch away from you when you offer treatment. Trust, once freely given, now has to be earned.",
        "You feel The Ascended's eyes on you, their gaze a weight you cannot escape.",
        "Other clerics avoid you during gatherings. Your transgression has isolated you.",
        "The leader questions your interpretations of omens now. Your words no longer carry their previous weight.",
        "Apprentices are hesitant to train under you. Your reputation precedes you.",
        "You debate whether staying in this Clan is the right path.",
        "The gatherings feel different. Other Clans' clerics regard you warily, as if your actions have tainted the sacred bond you all share.",
        "Even the pups, who once looked at you with awe and fascination, now scurry away at your approach. The tales of your deeds have filtered down to even the youngest members of the Clan.",
        "The respect that the elders held for you has evaporated. Their warm tales of your skill and devotion are replaced with cold silence, and their eyes hold a look of disappointment.",
        "The Ascended's voices in your dreams grow faint. Their messages become obscured and it's harder to find guidance in your slumber.",
        "At the half-cycle meeting, you wake up to a rot-filled forest instead of golden meadows.",
        "Slugcats take longer to recover under your care. Whether it's their fear or your guilt affecting the healing, you can't tell.",
        "An unexpected illness spreads through the Clan. Some slugcats mutter that it's a punishment from The Ascended.",
        "You hear the elders talking about the old cleric, how they were so skilled and how slugcats these days aren't the same.",
        "The once comforting presence of the The Ascended guide feels distant now, leaving you feeling even more isolated."

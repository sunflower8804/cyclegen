        "The queens, who once trusted you to resolve quarrels amongst their pups, now steer their young ones away from you. Their disappointed looks serve as a bitter reminder of your deeds.",
        "Every disagreement in the Clan now seems amplified, your guilt twisting every dispute into a possible harbinger of violence.",
        "As the Clan's mediator, your role was to solve conflicts, not create them. The trust that your Clanmates once had in your ability to maintain peace has vanished.",
        "Slugcats avoid bringing their issues to you, preferring to solve them by themselves or let them fester.",
        "You notice the Clans' younger slugcats, the pups and apprentices, who once looked up to you as a role model, now regard you with fear and uncertainty.",
        "Your words fall on deaf ears at gatherings, the other Clans no longer willing to listen to a murderer mediate.",
        "You notice more fights breaking out within your Clan. The peace you had worked hard to maintain shatters.",
        "Younger slugcats ask their mentors about your actions, their innocent curiosity stinging more than any accusation.",

        "The trust that once enabled you to mediate effectively has evaporated, making your role seem impossible.",
        "Slugcats speak in hushed tones when you approach, leaving you paranoid about their conversations.",
        "You struggle to sleep, haunted by the memory of your actions and the implications they hold for your role within the Clan."
